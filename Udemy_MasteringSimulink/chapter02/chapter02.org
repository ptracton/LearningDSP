* The Basics
** Create and Simulate Your First Model
- New \rightarrow simulink model in video but mine has a Simulink button and to choose "Blank Model"
- Best Practice put inputs on left, logic in middle and outputs on right
- Simulation \rightarrow Model Configuration Parameters 
- Print out as PDF and use http://pdf2png.com/ to convert

** Introduction to Common Logic Blocks
- The window for setting parameters for a block is called a *Mask*
- You can build your own subsystems with your own masks
- *Best Practice* set up parameters in .m file, run it, populate your constants with the names and display parameter name
- Right click on block \rightarrow Format \rightarrow unclick show block name and then expand block to show name
- *Constant Block* give it a direct value or define parameter name in Matlab and use it
- Be careful with divide by 0 issues
- Source are Inputs
- Sinks are Outputs
- Ports and Subsystems are good for breaking up models
- User Defined Functions lets us write matlab code and drop into a block
- Mux and Demux allows us to put signals into or out of arrays good for vector operations
- Lookup Tables also known as maps, allow us to interpolate a signal
** Inputs
- Want to use clock for continuous time instead of digital clock
- Want to use digital clock for discrete time, probably better for me since we want to run on hardware
- Scopes are great for outputs
- There is a free running counter that will keep going
- There is a counter limited counter that will automatically reset
- Signal Builder lets you do custom signals, can feed it excel spread sheets
- Random Number and Uniform Random Number blocks you need determines which 
- Band Limited Noise will add noise to signals
- From file will read .mat files
- From workspace lets you get from workspace

** Outputs
- Scopes can take multiple inputs for displaying on graph
- can display on one or more graphs via Layout
- 
** Data types, Inheritance, Sample Rates and Selected Subsystems
** Solvers
