* The Basics
** Create and Simulate Your First Model
- New \rightarrow simulink model in video but mine has a Simulink button and to choose "Blank Model"
- Best Practice put inputs on left, logic in middle and outputs on right
- Simulation \rightarrow Model Configuration Parameters 
- Print out as PDF and use http://pdf2png.com/ to convert

** Introduction to Common Logic Blocks
- The window for setting parameters for a block is called a *Mask*
- You can build your own subsystems with your own masks
- *Best Practice* set up parameters in .m file, run it, populate your constants with the names and display parameter name
- Right click on block \rightarrow Format \rightarrow unclick show block name and then expand block to show name
- *Constant Block* give it a direct value or define parameter name in Matlab and use it
- Be careful with divide by 0 issues
- Source are Inputs
- Sinks are Outputs
- Ports and Subsystems are good for breaking up models
- User Defined Functions lets us write matlab code and drop into a block
- Mux and Demux allows us to put signals into or out of arrays good for vector operations
- Lookup Tables also known as maps, allow us to interpolate a signal
** Inputs
- Want to use clock for continuous time instead of digital clock
- Want to use digital clock for discrete time, probably better for me since we want to run on hardware
- Scopes are great for outputs
- There is a free running counter that will keep going
- There is a counter limited counter that will automatically reset
- Signal Builder lets you do custom signals, can feed it excel spread sheets
- Random Number and Uniform Random Number blocks you need determines which 
- Band Limited Noise will add noise to signals
- From file will read .mat files
- From workspace lets you get from workspace

** Outputs
- Scopes can take multiple inputs for displaying on graph
- can display on one or more graphs via Layout
- 
** Data types, Inheritance, Sample Rates and Selected Subsystems
- Simulink defaults to 64 bit double values
- Can change this in the Parameters, defaults are usually good, for embedded systems you will want to shrink data down to size.
- Watch out for signed/unsigned issues and numbers
- fixdt good for compiling into hardware, fixed point needs to be handled carefully
- fixdt(signed, bit size, fractional size)
- Some logic runs are different rates, some once a second, some once a milisecond, etc...
- Display \rightarrow Sample Time \rightarrow colors will color code different sample rate blocks
- Redo the colors command to refresh/update after changes to design
- Sample Time field is in seconds, so 10 mS is 0.010
- Triggered Subsystems lets you make an action happen on a rising or falling edge
- Enabled Subsystems lets you make an action happen while a condition is true

** Discrete vs Continuous Solvers 
- Simulation \rightarrow Model Configuration Parameters
- Simulink has 1 discrete solver
- Set the solver to discrete, fixed step size, start time, stop time.  Step size is in seconds, 100 mS is 0.1
- For continuous, set variable step size, you can set min/max steps, and tolerances.  Accuracy vs Speed
- Start with powerful ode45 and go to less powerful ode23 is sim time is too long
- Numerical solvers documentation is not great
