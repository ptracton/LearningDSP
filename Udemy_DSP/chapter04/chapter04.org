** Time and Frequency Domain
- Signal Domains Time vs. Frequency
  - Up to now we have only considered the time domain.
    - This is where the signal is represented by a sequence of numbers.  Each representing the amplitude of the signal at a given point in time.
- Frequency Domain
  - Rather than a sequnce of numbers representing amplitude vs. time we have amplitude vs. frequency.
  - Why is this useful?
    - Signal Inspection
      - Viewing a signal in the frequency domain allows the analyst to very easily discern the which frequencies have the most power.
      - This is useful in filter design where we would like to manipulate the frequency content of a signal to suit our purposes.  Can't manipulate what you don't know.
    - Convolution
      - Convolution and Multiplication are duals of each other in different domains
      - convolution in time is multiplication in frequency
      - convolution in frequency is multiplication in time
      - convolution is computationally efficient in frequency domain!

** Convolution Example
- Time to process n data points via convolution in time domain grows at $n^{2}$ This is bad!

** Enter the DFT
- Convolution and time/from time/frequency domains can be computationally expensive
- Frequency complexity grows slower than time domain especially once n $\geq$ 100 which is not large at all.
- Comparison
  - Convolution is porportional to $n^2$ and written as $O(n^2)$
  - The transform method is computationally $O(n*log_{2}(n))$
  - Cross over at 128 points
*** Fourier Transform
- Originated by Joseph Fourier in 1822
- [[https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/][Analog Fourier Transform]]
\begin{equation}
F(s) = \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} e^{-2\pi jxs}dx
\end{equation}
  - Converts an analog signal to a sum of coefficients representing its amplitude and phase at each frequency in the frequency domain.
  - Transforms the function f(x) from a function in independent variable x to one in independent variable s.
- [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiscreteFourierTransform.html][Discrete Fourier Transform]]
\begin{equation}
X_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} e^{\frac{-2\pi i k n}{N}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x_{n} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_{k} e^{\frac{2\pi i k n}{N}}
\end{equation}
  - Converts a discrete sequence of values to another sequence of values (in general complex) representing amplitude and phase at each frequency up to the Nyquist rate for the sequence.
    - Also transforms from time(n) to frequency(k)
** DFT Computation Example
- After using the DFT on a signal we can get the frequency response of the signal
\begin{equation}
|X_{k}| = \sqrt{Re(X_{k})^{2} + Im(X_{k})^{2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\theta_{k} = tan^{-1}\frac{ Im(X_{k}) } {Re(X_{k})}
\end{equation}

- Notice the reflection of the response due to aliasing above the Nyquist rate.
*** Fast Fourier Transform
- Cooley and Tukey in 1965
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform][Reduces complexity via symmetry]]
  - Original DFT $O(n^2)$
  - FFT $O(nlog(n))$
- Reference [[http://www.fftw.org][Free C Implementation]]

*** Application to Convolution
- As mentioned previously the DFT cna be used to perform convolution.
  - Side Effect: convolution is circular and not linear
    - This can be the same answer in certain conditions
    - We generally want linear convolution since circular does not give proper results when filtering
  - In order to do it linearly there must be enough room (/padding/) in the 2 signals
    - Choose a period size N for both sequences that is equal to or greater than L + M -1 where L and M are the sizes of the 2 sequences.
    - Power of 2 is good, FFT is fastest this way.
    - Extend each input to N samples and set those extra samples to 0
** The Z Transform
- Z Transform is a generalization of the DFT
  - Z plane is digital complex plain
  - S plane is the analog complex plain
  - Much like Laplace is to the analog Fourier Transform
  - The DFT is equivalent to the Z Transform evaluated on a unit circle
- What is it?
\begin{equation}
X(z) = \sum_{n} x[n]z^{-n}
\end{equation}
  - Powers of z are often interpreted as delays in the system where the power represents the number of times the signal is delayed.
    - $z^{-2}$ is a two clock cycle delay
  - Offers a powerful method of system description and analysis
    - Can obtain a rational /transfer function/ of a system that will allow us to find /poles/ and /zeros/ of a system and determine its behavior.
*** Common Z Tranform Pairs
**** TODO Find the list and put it here
*** Transfer Functions
- Consider a system with impulse response /h/
  - The output of such a system can be obtained from the input such that
\begin{equation}
y(n) = x(n)*h(n)
\end{equation}
  - If we take the Z transform of the system we can obtain a /transfer function/
\begin{equation}
\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = H(z)
\end{equation}
  - When we form H(z) as a rational polynomial function (a ratio of 2 polynomial functions) we can easily discern the /poles/ and /zeros/ of the system.
*** Poles and Zeros
- Definitions
  - /Zero/ of a system is a value of the complex frequency Z that will for the transfer function to a 0
  - /Pole/ is a value of z which will cause the transfer function to become unbounded, i.e. infinite
- Finding them can be accomplished via analysis of the transfer function
  - Given a rational transfer function
\begin{equation}
H(z) = \frac{b_{m}z^{m} + ... b_{1}Z^{1} + b_{0}}{a_{n}z^{n} + ... + a_{1}z^{1} + a_{0}}
\end{equation}
  - We can consider the numerator and denominator as separate equations
    - The roots of the numerators are the /zeros/
    - The roots of the denominator are the /poles/, the characteristic equation
- We can factor the equation to arrive at a different form
\begin{equation}
H(z) = \frac{(z-z_{1})(z-z_{2})}...(z-z_{m}){(z-p_{1})(z-p_{2})...(z-p_{n})}
\end{equation}
  - Here $z_{1}$ through $z_{m}$ are the /zeros/ and $p_{1}$ through $p_{n}$ are the /poles/
*** Pole Placement and Response
- Poles outside the unit circle grow exponentially
- Poles inside the unit circle decay
- Poles right on unit circle are /marginally stable/ and oscillate
- The characteristic equation is so called dueo the polse major effect on the behavior of the system
  - The figure shows how systems with different pole locations react to the exact same input (an impulse)
  - It should be noted that while pole placement dominates the characterization of the system resposne zeros also influence it.
  - Many filters are designed specifically to /not/ use poles.  This has certain performance advantages in real time systems.
