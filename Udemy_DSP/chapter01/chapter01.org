*** Preliminary Concpets
- A  signal is a carrier of information.  An sort of physical or computable quantity which we give a meaning
- An analog signal can have any value at any time.
- A digital signal is a signal whose values are discrete numbers.    Only exist at finite points of time and values.
**** Systems vs. Signals
- A system is anything that can modify a signal, physically or electrically.
- Often represented as a function or transform
\begin{equation}
Y = F(x)
\end{equation}
**** Linear Shift Invariant Systems (LSI) 
- Linear -- super position applies
\begin{equation}
F(x) = g 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
F(y) = h
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
F(ax+by) = ag + bh
\end{equation}
- Shift invariant - shape of system output does not vary with starting point.  You want this. 
- associative and commutative
- Analog to Linear Time Invariant system in time domain
\begin{equation}
if x(n) \rightarrow y(n) then x(n-n_{0}) \rightarrow y(n-n_{0})
\end{equation}

**** Sequence Properties
- Periodicity
A sequence is periodic if there exist a period T such that for all n and k
\begin{equation}
x(n+Tk) = x(n)
\end{equation}

- Symmetry
  + A sequence is even if for every n $x(n) = x(-n)$  Mirrored in y axis
  + A sequence is odd if for every n, $x(n) = -x(-n)$ Mirrored and x and y axis
  + A sequnce is /conjugate symmetric/ if for all n x(n) = x^{*}(-n)  * is complex conjugate
  + A sequnce is /conjugate asymmetric/ if for all n x(n) = -x^{*}(-n)

**** Fundamental Sequences
- Can shift these signals
- Unit Sample, digital equivalent of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function][Dirac Delta function]].

\begin{equation}
\delta(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & n = 0 \\
0 & otherwise
\end{array}
\right
\end{equation}

- Unit step, digital equivalent of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function][Heaviside Step Function]]
\begin{equation}
u(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & n \geq  0 \\
0 & otherwise
\end{array}
\right
\end{equation}

**** Definitions
- A system is /stable/ is the output is bounded for all bounded inputs.  
  + $Y = F(x)$ is finite if x is finite
- A system is /causal/ if the current output depends only on the current input, previous inputs or previous outputs.  It does *not* need to look into future to work.
**** System Representaion
- Three common methods of representing a system
  - Difference Equation
  - Block Diagram
  - Signal Flow Graph
- Difference Equation
  - Digital counter part to a differential equation
  - Represent the output as a combination of previous inputs and outputs
\begin{equation}
y_{k} = \sum_{n = - \infty}^{k-1} a_{n}x_{n} + \sum_{n=-\infty}^{k-1} b_{n}y_{n}
\end{equation}
  - When output depends only on previous input and not previous output the system is known to have /Finite Impulse Response/ and we categorize these as FIR. No feedback in system.  b coefficients are 0.
  - The converse is also true and those systems are known as /Infinite Impulse Response/ or IIR.  There is feedback in the system. b coefficients are non zero.
**** Example Problems
 - $y_{k} = \alpha y_{k-1} + x_{k}$ where input $x_{k} = b^{k}$ for $k \geq 0$
 - Step 1 Homogeneous Solution
   - set equation to be equal to 0
   - $y_{k} - \alpha y_{k-1} = 0$ which yields the characteristic equation $r - \alpha = 0$
   - Thus $y_{k_{h}} = c_{1}\alpha^{k} + c_{2}$
 - Step 2 Particular Solution
   - [[http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/UndeterminedCoefficients.aspx][Undetermined Coefficients]], assume $y_{k_{p}} = c_{3}b^{k}$ due to form of input
   - Plug into difference equations to find coefficient.
     - $c_{3}b^{k} = \alpha c_{3}b^{k-1} + b^{k}$
     - $c_{3} = \frac{1}{1-\frac{a}{b}}$
 - Step 3 Combine
   - Yields solution $y_{k} = c_{1}\alpha^{k} + \frac{1}{1-\frac{a}{b}} b^{k} + c_{2}$
   - Need to know initial conditions to solve for $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$

**** Block Diagrams
  - Represent the flow of information in a visual manner
  - Basic components are unit delay (often $z^{-1}$), sum and gains/multiply
  - Useful in implementation

**** Signal Flow Graph
  - Similar to block diagram, different appearance
  - Each node is considered summation
